jquery-checkbox-edit

I made this for large forms where we had multiple blocks with options to select, but a multi-select wasn't the correct metaphor.

usage: put your checkboxes with labels for each in a div with a class jq-checkboxes
let'r rip                                                     



I have a rails helper i am working on also "checkboxes_for_collection" (name tbd)

enjoy
